<app_structure>
Encore uses a monorepo design where one app contains the entire backend. Enables distributed tracing and Encore Flow through unified application model. Supports both monolith and microservices architectures with monolith-style developer experience.

Sub-packages are internal to services, cannot define APIs, used for helpers and code organization.
Notice that we put encore.app inside apps so apps become the root folder.

## Backend Services Organization

**CRITICAL: All backend services must be located under `apps/backend/` directory.**

This project uses a structured separation between backend and frontend code:

```
apps/
  backend/                  # ALL backend services go here
    auth/                 # Authentication service
    middleware/            # Shared middleware
    spa/                  # SPA proxy service
    ...
  frontend/               # Frontend application
    app/
    package.json
  internal/               # Internal utilities
  start/                 # Startup binary project
  go.mod                  # Encore Go module
  encore.app              # Encore configuration
logs/                    # Application logs (auto-created)
  backend.log             # Encore/backend output with timestamps
  frontend.log            # Frontend dev server output with timestamps
```

### Why This Matters

1. **Encore Service Discovery**: Encore scans directories for `//encore:service` annotations. Services scattered outside `apps/backend/` create duplicate service names and confusion.

2. **Clear Separation**: Backend business logic is cleanly separated from frontend code and infrastructure.

3. **Import Organization**: Backend services can easily import shared middleware and utilities using `"encore.app/backend/middleware"` style paths.

### Import Paths

From `apps/backend/auth/auth.go`:
```go
import (
    "encore.app/backend/middleware"  // Shared middleware
    "encore.app/internal/dbx"       # Internal utilities
)
```

## Running the Application

### Building Binaries

**IMPORTANT: All make commands must be run from the repository root directory.**

Use the Makefile at the repository root to build startup binaries for different platforms and environments:

```bash
# From repository root:
cd /path/to/base

# Build all binaries (dev for Linux/macOS/Windows, prod for Linux)
make all

# Build specific targets
make dev.linux    # Linux development binary
make dev.macos    # macOS ARM64 development binary
make dev.exe      # Windows development binary
make prod.linux   # Linux production binary (optimized with -s -w)

# Clean built binaries
make clean
```

**Binary Types:**

- **`dev.*` binaries** - Development builds with full debugging symbols and logging. Use these for local development and testing. The `env=dev` build flag enables development-specific features like verbose logging and relaxed security.

- **`prod.*` binaries** - Production builds optimized for deployment. Stripped of debug symbols (`-s -w` ldflags) for smaller size and better performance. The `env=prod` build flag enables production-hardened settings.

Binaries are output to the repository root with descriptive names (e.g., `dev.macos`, `prod.linux`).

### Logging

**All application output is automatically logged using PTY (pseudo-terminal) sessions.**

When running the application:
- Real-time output (with colors) is displayed in your terminal
- Clean, timestamped logs are written to `logs/` directory:
  - `logs/backend.log` - Encore/backend output (ANSI codes stripped)
  - `logs/frontend.log` - Frontend dev server output (ANSI codes stripped)

The logs directory is automatically created on first run. Use `make clean-logs` to remove log files.

### Versioning

Set a custom version during build (run from repository root):
```bash
make VERSION=2.1.0 all
```

## Encore Skills

This project uses skills to provide focused documentation for Encore development. Skills are automatically loaded when relevant.

Available skills:
- `encore-startup-system` - Build and run startup binaries, port management, upgrades
- `encore-apis-services` - Define APIs, services, raw endpoints, service-to-service calls
- `encore-databases` - SQL databases, migrations, external and shared databases
- `encore-infrastructure` - Caching, object storage, pub/sub, cron jobs, secrets
- `encore-auth-config` - Authentication, configuration, CORS, errors, metadata
- `encore-testing` - Testing, mocking, middleware, validation, CGO
- `encore-advanced-patterns` - Clerk auth, dependency injection, streaming, metrics, health checks, rate limiting, multi-tenancy
- `encore-frontend` - Frontend development with Bun
- `encore-deployment` - Docker deployment guidelines

**Note**: Setting `id` field in `encore.app` forces Encore cloud usage. This project deploys using Docker with own infrastructure - never set an app ID.
