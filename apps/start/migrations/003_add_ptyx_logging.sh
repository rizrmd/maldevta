echo "  - Startup binary now captures all output (Encore + frontend) using PTY"
echo "  - Logs are written to logs/backend.log and logs/frontend.log"
echo "  - ANSI escape codes are stripped from log files for readability"
echo "  - Console output still displays with full colors"

echo "Next steps:"
echo "  1. Rebuild startup binary: make dev.macos (or make all)"
echo "  2. Run as usual: ./dev.macos or make run"
echo "  3. Check logs in logs/ directory"
